# K10x1
A text mule to practice elementary concepts that will be used to solve problem
7 of chapter 10 of, "Kochan, Stephen, Programming in C 4th ed."
## Things to do
### First thing
 create an array of integers, and a function to print the array out. Make use
of pointers to pass the array and array size to printArra(), use pointers in
the loop index variables.
### Second thing
create a printArray() function. It uses printf("%i ", \*(a + index))
is there another way to reference and travel through the array?
I am going to change printArray to try another style of using pointers.
